Maze Viewer
===========

A dead simple _viewer_ to help students with a class assignment. The only reason this "project" has a README at all is because I'm using the excellent tiles from RLTiles (tiles from NetHack, Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup, etc), unmodified. So here are the credits:

Part of (or All) the graphic tiles used in this program is the Public domain roguelike tileset "RLTiles". 

You can find the original tileset at: http://rltiles.sf.net 
You can find Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup modified tilesets at: http://code.google.com/p/crawl-tiles/downloads/list
